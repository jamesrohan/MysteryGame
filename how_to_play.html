					This is a mystery game in which you are looking for your friends who went missing over the weekend.
					particularly your girlfriend and her sister. There are other friends there but you are most concerned with the two 
					afformentioned friends. There was a storm in the mountain your girlfriend along with your best friend and others
					stayed at the cabin and you could not get in contact due to the storm since the day before. The mountain has been cursed
					the Native Americans who used to live there before being displaced by settlers. The curse is one that turns man into 
					wendigo, a beast that can only be killed by fire. Wendigo's are stronger and faster than humans they sense by motion. 
					They attack on site and will 9/10 kill you before you can react. Wendigos are created when man resorts to cannibalism.
					If a human eats human flesh on this mountain they and their victim become wendigos.

					There are clues scattered about that paint a story of what happened in the mountain. choose where you go next based 
					on the clues you find throughout your journey. Some clues lead to trouble some lead to dead ends. If you make the wrong 
					choice you may end up in a pit, or eaten by the wendigo's that come out at night until dawn. This is just an Alpha version
					of the game. So there is only one path currently to the victory goal. How ever in the future more paths loop into each other 
					result in dead ends or take you to the same destination. Future release will have multiple paths to the Victory.
