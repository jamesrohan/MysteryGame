				It is Sunday 9pm. You walk up to the front door of the cabin in the mountains. 
				This is where your friends were supposed to be. You also were supposed to be 
				here over the weekend but you got caught in the storm and never made it. No
				one has answered your calls and texts since Friday night. You are mostly concerned

				inside to see whats going on or swing around the back and investigate around the 
				cabin first?
